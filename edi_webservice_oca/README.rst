Configuration
=============

Go to "EDI -> Config -> Backends" and edit or create one. Find the tab
"Webservice" and add a webservice. On the webservice record you can
specify all the general parameters to connect to the service (see
webservice README for more details).

If you want to take full control on if/how the webservice is used you
can do it via exchange type's advanced settings.

Hence, assuming your webservice has a URL configured as
\`\ https://my.endpoint/%7Bpath%7D\ \`:

::

   components:
     send:
       usage: webservice.send  # or any custom component usage inheriting from this
       work_ctx:
         webservice:
           method: post  # mandatory
           url_params:
             path: endpoint1/foo

For each call related to this type, you'll get a POST request against
https://my.endpoint/endpoint/foo.

``url_params`` can contain all the keys need for URL interpolation.

In addition, you can user ``url`` to override the full url used for the
call per exchange type.

If you want to send data as bytes you can use the option send_as_bytes
like:

::

   [...]
         webservice:
           send_as_bytes: true
   [...]
